    "## EXAMPLE 1\n",
    "USER: What is the ISW effect?\n",
    "ASSISTANT: The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect describes the fact that cosmic microwave background photons gain energy as they fall into potential wells and lose it again as they climb back out. The origin of the effect is gravitational redshift. For static potential wells, there is no net effect. However, if the potentials grow or decay, there is a net effect, known as the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. In a matter-dominated universe, linear potentials stay constant. The late-time ISW effect refers to the fact that at late times, dark energy causes a deviation from matter domination and linear potentials decay. This causes an effect in the cosmic microwave background which has been measured in cross-correlation with large-scale structure. The early-time ISW refers to the fact that right after recombination, radiation still contributed a non-negligible amount of the energy density of the universe, causing potentials to grow. This causes the photons to gain energy.\n",
    "## EXAMPLE 2\n",
    "USER: What are the definitions of galaxy cluster mass (M200m, M500c, etc.)?\n",
    "ASSISTANT: Calculating a galaxy cluster's mass is like calculating the population of a sprawling city; as you get further out from city center, the suburbs never end. Eventually you have to stop counting and just say that from there on the people belong to a different town.\\nIn cluster masses, we integrate from the cluster center out to some radius rΔ where Δ might be 200, 500, or some other number. The definition of this radius is that the density of the enclosed mass is Δ times the average density of the universe at that redshift. The associated mass is MΔ.\\nOne more detail is that 'average density' can be defined in two ways. You can either include the energy density of dark energy - in which case you are comparing to the critical density at that redshift - or you can use the matter density only. This choice results in the c or m subscript (stands for critical or mean). Note that the critical density is higher than the mean density, so it gives an earlier cutoff in the integral. Therefore 'MΔc' masses are smaller than 'MΔm' ones.\n",
